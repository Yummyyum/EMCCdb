EMCCdb
======

Problem database/management system for the Exeter Math Club Competition (https://exeter-math.appspot.com/), implemented as a web app for Google App Engine. 

Currently, this interface supports the creation and management (i.e. tagging/categorization) of problems/solutions and the construction of tests.
